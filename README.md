## Abstract
People with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) have difficulty communicating with others due to limited speech capabilities. Assistive technology plays a vital role in alleviating their difficulties. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to understand human language and generate natural text. This report introduces a novel approach that uses LLMs as the foundation for a prototype communication interface that allows users to select responses in multiple tones - positive, neutral and negative, for queries posed to them, based on their preferences. A lightweight and userfriendly browser-based chat interface is also developed to enable seamless interaction. This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLMs, taking into consideration their parameter sizes, training data, hardware requirements and licensing constraints. Prompt engineering is used to fine-tune the models to incorporate specific criteria relevant to individuals with MND. A user study providing valuable insights into the overall satisfaction, effectiveness and user-friendliness of the models was carried out and is presented along with an extensive qualitative analysis. The tone of the generated responses from the various models is also quantitatively evaluated by bench-marking it against BERT, a state-of-the-art language understanding model. Among the evaluated models (GPT-3.5 Turbo without memory, GPT-3.5 Turbo with memory, Hugging chat, Alpaca 7B, Google BARD) GPT-3.5 Turbo with memory emerged as the superior model.
